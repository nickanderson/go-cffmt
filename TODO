* qstring needs to be done before Text is removed, as this is important for qstrings we make only for single quotes, backticks
    solve in chroma?

- comments in lists (on new lines are not correctly handled), parse error?
- single quote strings come out badly from chroma - maybe fix there?

- special comment -> no parse and then we just stop??

TODO:

- comments in lists (probably parsed, can output them as well - as we can detect them)
    need items over multiple lines
- thinarrow
- long lists break them up
- walk.go to to toplevel

gitlab_server.cf failes because single quote with comment in them #more
autofs.cf same
users_autofs same
incinga.cf comment in list
