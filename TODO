TODO:

1. multiline comments need some work. We need to know if
    a) multiline
    b) at EOL or first non-space on the line.
2. some files (forgot which ones) are ugly pretty printed
   mostly to do with comments in list or functions

It might be a good idea to _not_ have any comments print their newlines and just add them
as we see fit...
